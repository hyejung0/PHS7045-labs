Computer Level :

1. Computer = Nodes
2. CPU
3. cores
4. SIMD threads

1. SIMD instruction : use one core but have multiple threads. Core has multiple threads, it depends on the computer. But using SIMD threads in c++ programming. 

If I am using for loop, and it takes long, use OpenMP (use Rcpp to use for loop).
